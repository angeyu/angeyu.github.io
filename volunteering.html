              <p>While traveling in Taiwan, I felt lonely and disconnected. Then one day I came across two Taiwanese kids crying over thier English homework in a 7-Eleven, and I happily lent them my native English skills. This small interaction helped me feel connected to humanity again.</p>
              <p><strong>How many others would like to volunteer, but aren't always sure where to start?</strong></p>

              <p>As humans, we all have the innate wish to have purpose and a sense of belonging. Yet, over <strong>90 percent</strong> of Americans want to volunteer but only <strong>one out of four</strong> individuals actually do*. We want to find out what’s stopping people from volunteering and to ideate the possible solutions.</p>
              <p> Our 5-person team conducted a 3-phase user research case study over the course of 10 weeks to understand how people typically find and participate in volunteering opportunities.</p>
