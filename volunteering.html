                <p>Over <strong>90 percent</strong> of Americans want to volunteer but only <strong>one out of four</strong> individuals actually do*. We want to find out what’s stopping people from volunteering and to create GoodDeed, an app to remove these barriers.</p>
                <p> Our 5-person team conducted a 3-phase case study over the course of 6 weeks to understand how people typically find and participate in volunteering opportunities.</p>

                <h5>(10 participants, qualitative)</h5>
                <h6>How do people currently find volunteering opportunities?</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method allows us to understand the underlying structures and habits of users when they set out to find and join a volunteering opportunity.</li>
                    <li>We asked participants to walk through all the steps they took to join, onboard, and participate in a volunteering opportunity.</li>

                <h6>What are the barriers people face?</h6>

                <ul>
                    <li>This stage focuses on specific variables uncovered from previous studies</li>
                    <li>Our 20 question survey seeks to understand which product features resonate with users</li>
