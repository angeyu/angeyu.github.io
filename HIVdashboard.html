                <p>Researchers at the Institute of Sexual and Gender Minority Health wanted a way to quickly view the landscape of HIV research. This dashboard consolidates the systematic reviews of 239 peer-reviewed US-based studies into 1900+ determinants to provide a visual way of analyzing hundreds of articles.</p>
                <p>The aim of this tool is to give implementation researchers and practitioners access to the articles and implementation findings of systematic reviews that can help to inform delivery of HIV programs and services. </p>

                <h3>Phase 1: Contextual Inquiry Field Study </h3>
                <h5>(10 participants, qualitative)</h5>
                <h6>How do people currently find volunteering opportunities?</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method allows us to understand the underlying structures and habits of users when they set out to find and join a volunteering opportunity.</li>
                    <li>We asked participants to walk through all the steps they took to join, onboard, and participate in a volunteering opportunity.</li>
